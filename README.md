# finance_rb

This package is a ruby native port of the numpy-financial package with some helpful additional functions.

The functions in this package are a scalar version of their vectorised counterparts in  the [numpy-financial](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-financial) library.

Currently, only some functions are ported,  
which are as follows:
